# 🏕️Enchantments Permit Lottery

Wilderness permits for the rugged and beautiful Enchantment Permit Area can be extremely difficult to obtain. On the most popular days, only <b>1 in 400</b> applications was awarded a permit!

Each permit entry costs $6 USD and is limited to one per person. I've collected information from the lottery statistics data published byt te USDA Forest Service to help you make the best selection possible. 

I'm making my code and .csv files available which are much more useful than the 520 page PDF file provided by USDA Forest Service.

##🍀Lottery Selection Tool: Heatmap
You can use provided data and plotting functions to make better informed decisions when selecting your permit dates.

E.g. I am booking a trip during the final week of July. I am available to hike on any of July-22 through July-28. My preference is Core Zone, but I am ok with Stuart zone if the probability of a successfully awarded ticket is 9% compared to just 2% in core for the same date (Sunday July 23, 2023).
