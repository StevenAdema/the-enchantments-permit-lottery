# 🏕️Enchantments Permit Lottery

Wilderness permits for the rugged and beautiful Enchantment Permit Area can be extremely difficult to obtain. On the most popular days, only <b>1 in 400</b> applications was awarded a permit!

Each permit entry costs $6 USD and is limited to one per person. I've collected information from the lottery statistics data published byt te USDA Forest Service to help you make the best selection possible. 

I'm making my code and .csv files available which are much more useful than the 520 page PDF file provided by USDA Forest Service.
